***Information***
- - - T3

Transmission System 3 or Transmission 3 (T3) is a point-to-point connection line that is capable of transmitting data signals at a 44.736 Mbps speed rate. This type of data transmission relies heavily on several layers of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to transmit these channels that carry data across private networks.

T3 is a high-speed data transmission line that is often used in areas requiring high bandwidth and uninterrupted data transmission. These are areas that hold a large store of data resources, such as large organizations, huge companies, or research centers. In large companies, these lines provide a reliable connection that can be used to build the base of a company’s network system. Since T3 lines are symmetrical and duplexed, meaning that it offers equal download and upload speeds, it also enables simultaneous data transmission without causing any traffic in the network. T3 is also referred to as Digital Signal 3 (DS3).

- T3 Framing Structure

A T3 line carries 672 channels that each run at 64 Kbps. In order to create a single transmission line from these channels, a T3 connection relies on a TDM which is necessary since it functions as a multiplexer that interweaves the data channels. A multiplexer is similar to a digital switch that accepts the individual channels and has a singular output. These digital signals are multiplexed over different time slots, enabling several channels to be carried on the same data line. This is also why each channel is also called a timeslot.

Each channel that goes into the TDM, is initially created from analog signals that are encoded and translated via a PCM. 8000 samples are taken from an analog signal and are converted into an 8-bit value. This is carried at a rate of 64 Kbps. This 8-bit value and 64 Kbps base speed, are referred to as the Digital Signal 0 (DS0) rate. DS0 is the base unit for these data channels, and are converted into higher capacities through the multiplexing process. This is why the multiplexing process is identified as being octet-oriented or relying on an 8-bit value system.

Initially, a T3 line starts as a quartet of T1 lines multiplexed to create a T2 line. Each T1 frame of data contains the 24 channels, each carrying 8 bits of data, along with an additional framing bit that works to synchronize the data frames. The 4 T1 lines create a T2. An M13 (Multiplex T1 to T3) does this and also multiplexes a set of 7 T2 lines to form the T3 transmission line. With each channel running at 64 Kbps, a speed of 42.924 Mbps is achieved through these layers of multiplexing. Additionally, stuff bits function to aid in signaling and control of data transmission. Overall, a T3 line can provide a connection speed up to 44.736 Mbps.

A 4 wire twisted pair circuit can serve as the transmission medium of a T3 communication pathway, however, the signal will not run for more than 50ft. Use of modern wiring technologies such as coaxial cables, and optical fibers, or even microwaves are more suitable to carry out this type of data transmission.
