# Software description

This is the official OpenVPN Connect client software for Windows workstation platforms developed and maintained by OpenVPN Inc. This is the recommended client program for the OpenVPN Access Server to enable VPN for Windows. The latest version of OpenVPN for Windows is available on our website.

If you have an OpenVPN Access Server, it is recommended to download the OpenVPN Connect client software directly from your own Access Server, as it will then come pre configured for use for VPN for Windows. The version available here contains no configuration to make a connection, although it can be used to update an existing installation and retain settings. 


# Exploit description

The permissive folder permission in "C:\ProgramData\OpenVPN Connect" allows an attacker without admin rights to place a malicious DLL next to tapinstall.exe.
As soon as OpenVPN client is installed or upgraded, the malicious DLL is loaded by tapinstall and the shellcode is executed.

## DLLs searched by tapinstall:

DEVRTL.dll
SPINF.dll
drvstore.dll
DEVOBJ.dll
newdev.dll
VCRUNTIME140.dll

## Steps To Reproduce

- Drop a malicious drvstore.dll in C:\ProgramData\OpenVPN Connect\drivers\tap\amd64\win10
- Install openvpn-connect-3.1.0.361_signed.msi
- Shellcode is executed with the SYSTEM account

## Impact

A possible attacker obtains system privileges
